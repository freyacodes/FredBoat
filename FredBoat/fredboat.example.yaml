database:

    # In PostgreSQL, role means user and vice versa. Keep that in mind when reading the following help and the provided links.
    # If you are running your own PostgreSQL database, you will need to provide a role and a database belonging to that role.
    # The role needs at least the permission to log in.
    # All postgres databases used by FredBoat are required to have the Hstore extension enabled.

    jdbcUrl:          ""

    # Ssh tunnel for a remote database. this is useful for when you don't want to expose your database on the remote server
    # and instead use ssh tunneling to access it
    # If you are running with docker-compose then you don't need to change any ssh value here.
    # If you are using an SSH tunnel, you need to point your jdbc url to localhost and the configured tunnelLocalPort
    # Keep the sshHost an empty string for no tunnel.

    # They CANNOT be the same database due to the way flyway migrations work.
    # The main benefit is that you don't have to backup/migrate the cache database, it can just be dropped/recreated
    # If you do not provide a jdbc url for the cache database, FredBoat will still work (most likely), but may have a degraded
    # performance, especially in high usage environments and when using Spotify playlists.
